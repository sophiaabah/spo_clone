This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This app uses Spotify's API and SDK to display a user's content and initialize an instance of the Spotify Player to stream music in real time from the clone, creating a similar experience. 

If you want to preview the webpage, note that Spotify requires users to be registered in my developer dashboard, before this app can be used with your Spotify account.
